# Log External

You can configure external log import to publish logger events when logs from
other loggers are created. This can be used to publish logs:

-   when other apps/managed packages you don't own are using their own log
    objects
-   from your own legacy log object

Fully configurable through:

-   [External Log Import](../../reference/ok__External_Log_Import__mdt.md)
-   [External Log Field Mapping](../../reference/ok__External_Log_Field_Mapping__mdt.md)

The list of configured external logs is available
[here](../../extensions/external-logs-for-one-logger.md).
